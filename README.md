# Project : 1 [Scraping Students Information From a Website And Attach it To a DataFrame](https://github.com/MohamedEltantawy0/students-information-gathering.git)
 Created a small script to enter the website and loginto it because it needs to login to start scraping
 website need to login a again every  minutes so i am getting the headers ad cookies multiple times for big data scraping
 I have created small easy and simple script to take two numbers the first is our start and the second is where we stop
 I made some lists to save the data i gatherd at so i can make a small dataframe with pandas , save it and save the final result in csv file
