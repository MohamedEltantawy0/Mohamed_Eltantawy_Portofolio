### Project : 1 [Analyze and visualize sales of electronic store](https://github.com/MohamedEltantawy0/electronic-store-sales-analysis)
-First of all the data quality wasn't good so I added columns like(city and state, sales , order date) it makes my life easier
-after that I started to answer 5 questions:
what is the best month of sales and how much
What city sold the most product?
What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
what products are most ofen sold together
what product sold the most and why do you think it sold the most?
-These questions need to use various methods like (apply,groupby,count,counter,concat.....)
